In the last period, I start to interesting in [Application virtualization] also knows as __Container based virtualization__ or __Containerization__, at now I don't consider me an expert of virtualization, also I had some sporadical experience with virtual machines (for ex. with Azure and VMWare).

## Path
As application developer and architect my interesting falling into [Docker], a relatively recent project (initial release on March 2013), which has become increasingly more popular in the developer community.

Docker is not a virtualization layert but is a container that "automates the deployment of applications inside software containers", this container contains code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install on a server (see also [Docker Wiki]).
